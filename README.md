# bmi_calculator

BMI Calculator is a mobile application developed using Flutter that calculates a person's body mass index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The app allows users to input their measurements, and then uses a standard formula to determine their BMI. The app also provides an interpretation of the results, indicating whether the user's BMI is within a healthy range or if they are underweight or overweight. Additionally, the app can also track the user's BMI over time, allowing them to monitor any changes in their weight and overall health.
